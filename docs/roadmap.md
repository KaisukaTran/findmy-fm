## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Market data unavailable | Can't execute live | Multiple data providers, fallback feeds |
| Exchange down | Live trading stops | Circuit breakers, pause mechanism |
| Bug in execution | Financial loss | Extensive testing, paper-first validation |
| Regulatory change | Compliance issues | Legal consultation, flexible framework |
| Data loss | Historical records lost | Backup strategy, immutable audit trail |

**Phase 2**: None

**Phase 3**: None

**Phase 4**: Historical market data access

**Phase 5**: Strategy framework stabilization (Phase 3)
