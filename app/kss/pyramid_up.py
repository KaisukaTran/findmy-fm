"""
Pure math for the Pyramid-UP (Anti-Martingale "add to winners") strategy mode.

See docs/pyramid-up-plan.md. This is the OPPOSITE shape of the frozen DCA-down
ladder in ``app/kss/pyramid.py``:
  - DCA-down: add BELOW entry, quantity INCREASES each wave (pip × (n+1)).
  - Pyramid-up: add ABOVE entry, quantity DECREASES each wave (anti-martingale).
A coin that rips straight up after entry (no dip ever triggers a DCA buy) still
deploys capital by scaling INTO strength instead of sitting on idle reserve —
the WLFI session-26 case (entry 0.05793 → straight to +5.5%, wave-1 dip target
never touched, only $80 of $1,597 ever deployed).

FROZEN-safe: pure functions/dataclass only — no DB, no network, no `settings`
import. Every tunable is a function argument so this module is fully
unit-testable and reusable from the service layer without import-time
side effects. ``app/kss/pyramid.py`` is never touched.

Anti-martingale invariant (the cage): each add-on is STRICTLY smaller than the
previous one (0 < size_ratio < 1) and triggers STRICTLY above entry. This must
never become an inverted pyramid (larger adds the higher price goes) — that
would compound risk into a chasing trade instead of free-rolling a winner.
