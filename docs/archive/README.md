## How to Use

If you're looking for **current documentation** on features mentioned in these files:

1. **SELL Orders & Order Sides** → See [../execution.md](../execution.md#order-types)
2. **Trade Service Architecture** → See [../architecture.md](../architecture.md)
3. **Trade Lifecycle & P&L** → See [../modules.md](../modules.md#trade-service)
4. **API Endpoints for Trades** → See [../api.md](../api.md)

## Why Archived?

As the project matures, implementation-specific documentation becomes less useful. The key concepts and APIs are now integrated into the main documentation structure, which is easier to keep up-to-date and navigate.
